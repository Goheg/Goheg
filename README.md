# 👋 Hi, I'm Evans Ogidigo
### Backend Developer 

I build backend systems that actually serve people, not just meet technical specs.

Let's cut to the chase: You're here to see if I can solve problems, ship products, and bring value. The answer? ✅

I'm a developer with hands-on experience — not just pushing code, but building things that people use.

## 🌍 A Bit About Me

My journey into tech started with a Mechanical Engineering background, which gave me a strong foundation in problem-solving and systematic thinking. I'm a self-taught Node.js and Express developer who then expanded into mobile development with Jetpack Compose. This unique path gives me a practical, engineering-focused approach to building software.

I bring focused energy and a practical approach to development. I specialize in building real-world solutions that connect users with valuable services. From web applications to mobile apps, I work efficiently, think critically, and deliver.

My core stack is Node.js with Express, but the truth? Tools change. What matters is knowing how to use them to build things that work.

## 🚀 Projects That Matter

### 💡 Developer Philosophy
_"Code is like humor. When you have to explain it, it's bad."_ – Cory House  
I believe in writing clean, self-documenting code that just works.
